        Hello, my name is ProgrammerMarcus and I am a human. I like to take long
        walks around the beach because I enjoy the sound of the waves and the
        breeze. Sometimes, I do programming on my computer. While programming, I
        once lost my internet connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite thing to do at the beach is to build sandcastles. I like to
        use buckets, shovels, and molds to create different shapes and
        structures. I also like to decorate them with shells, stones, seaweed,
        and other things I find on the beach. When I am not building
        sandcastles, I like to relax in the shade. Relaxing in the shade can be
        comfortable, especially when its hot outside.
      </p>

        While building a sandcastle I was once attacked by crabs. Luckily, a had
        already built sand catapults so I was able to defend myself in the
        sandcastle I was relaxing at. Unfortunately, the sandcastle collapsed
        and I got sand in my mouth, which humans sometimes do. This event
        greatly traumatized me and cause me to develop a hatred for sand. Since
        then, I have not visited the beach.
