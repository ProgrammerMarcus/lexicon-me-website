        Hello, my name is ProgrammerMarcus and I am a human. I like to take long
        walks around the beach because I enjoy the sound of the waves and the
        breeze.

        My favorite thing to do at the beach is to build sandcastles. I like to
        use buckets, shovels, and molds to create different shapes and
        structures. I also like to decorate them with shells, stones, seaweed,
        and other things I find on the beach.
      </p>

        Once while building a sandcastle I was attacked by crabs. Luckily, a had built sand
        catapults so I was able to defend myself.
